  NAME

  discord - Generate binaural and chronaural tones to direct play or
  file.

  SYNOPSIS

  discord [flags] filename

  DESCRIPTION

  discord is a command line program used to generate binaural and
  chronaural beats mixed with tones, noise, or sound files of the
  users choice.  The default is to play the files via the computer's
  sound card, but they can be written to output files instead.  Only
  file formats available in libsndfile can be used as input.  Those
  formats do not include mp3 or ogg at this time, though the creator
  of libsndfile is thinking about adding ogg.  He is not adding mp3
  because of patent issues.  For practical purposes, this means wav,
  flac, or raw files on a PC, though au and aiff formats are also
  available.  If an input sound file has a different sample rate than
  that selected for the output, it will automatically resampled to the
  requested rate. A copy can be retained in the same directory as
  it was found with the new rate appended to the filename.  Output
  file types are limited to wav, flac, and raw; these are all lossless
  formats.

  While all of the options below can be used on the command line, the
  sequences to play must be defined in a configuration file.  Options
  on the command line override options in a configuration file.
  Configuration files are named with a .discord extension by
  convention.  You can, however, use whatever name you want for your
  configuration files.

  There are eight voice types in discord.  These are binaural,
  chronaural, bell, noise, stoch (stands for stochastic), sample,
  repeat, and once.

  Voice type description

  binaural

  Generate a pair of tones separated by a beat frequency at a specific
  carrier frequency and amplitude.  Optionally vary the amplitude of
  the left and right channels at a specified frequency and by a
  specified percent.  Binaural tones are allowed to slide into the
  next binaural on carrier, beat, amplitude, amplitude beat, and
  amplitude amount.

  chronaural

  Generate a periodic tone at a specified frequency and amplitude.
  The period is the beat in this case.  In addition, the split or pan
  of the tone can be specified to vary between set values at a rate
  specified.  Chronaural tones are allowed to slide into the next
  chronaural on carrier, beat, amplitude, and split beat.

  bell

  Generate a tone at a specified frequency and amplitude.  The tone
  may be fixed periodic or occur at randomly generated times between
  selected upper and lower limits.  Decay or enhance for the tone can
  also be set.  Bells can interrupt each other before they are
  finished playing.  No slide is available for bell.

  noise

  Generate a group of tones within a specified frequency and amplitude
  range.  The tones may be fixed periodic or occur at randomly
  generated times between selected upper and lower limits.  Decay or
  enhance for the tone can also be set.  Noise tones don't interrupt
  each other before they are finished playing.  No slide is available
  for noise.

  stoch

  Play a user supplied sound file at either fixed intervals or random
  intervals within specified times.  Pan and amplitude can vary for
  each play, or remain fixed depending on options specified.

  sample

  Play a randomly selected fixed time slices of a user supplied sound
  file continuously.  Pan and amplitude can vary with each sample or
  remain fixed, depending on the options specified.

  repeat

  Play a user supplied sound file continuously.  Pan and amplitude can
  vary with each repeat or remain fixed, depending on the options
  specified.

  once

  Play a user supplied sound file once at a specified time.  Pan and
  amplitude can be randomly chosen or be fixed, depending on the
  options specified.

  All internal processing is done in double format so the tones are
  very precise. The user specified sound files are stored in memory,
  so you should have lots of memory or use small sound files.  They
  are stored only once, no matter how many times they occur in the 
  sequence file.

  OPTIONS

  --bit_accuracy   -b

    bit accuracy of sound generated, 16i, 24i, 32i, 32f, 64f, i=int and
    f=float.  Only applies if you are sending to a file.
    
    Examples
      --bit_accuracy=16i
      -b 24i

  --compensate   -c

    compensate for human hearing, low and high freqs need to be
    louder, max 32 adjustment points are allowed.  The compensation
    points can all be on the same line or on multiple lines, but each
    line must start with the option name.  If this is correct, a sound
    at the compensated frequency sounds the same loudness as any other
    sound at its compensated frequency.  i.e. It linearizes the range.
    This is individual, depends on your hearing, so the above is only
    a starting point for you to play with and tweak.  For most people,
    sounds from about 800 Hz to 4000 Hz are the loudest and about
    equivalent.  Hearing falls off at either end so that the amplitude
    has to be higher in order for the sound to have the same loudness
    to the ear.  There is dispute about whether sounds outside the
    range of hearing have any effect.  If you use compensation, set
    all amplitudes to a constant value for binaural, chronaural, bell,
    and noise.  Or whatever ratio between the loudness you want them
    to have, as if linear.  The stoch, sample, repeat, and once voices
    are not compensated so should be set at the amplitude you want.

    Examples  (see also the test script files)
      --compensate=5=9'''3000=1'''',13000=3,,,,20000=11.0
      -c 5=10'''2530=1''',13128=3.5,,,,20000=10.0

  --display_only   -d

    display only, don't actually play any sequences

  --every   -e

    display status every x seconds

    Examples
      --every=10   
      -e 5

  --fast   -f

    fast, move through at multiple of time, 60 ==> 1min becomes 1 sec
    so a 1 hour play sequence will play in 1 minute.  Good for
    testing a new sequence for correctness, though obviously the
    effect won't be the same.

    Examples
      --fast=60
      -f 10

  --help   -h

    help

  --keep   -k

    keep any files generated by resampling.  Default is to delete the
    files when they are no longer needed.

  --out_format   -o

    output file format, w:wav, f:flac, r:raw

    Examples
      --out_format=w
      -o w

  --quiet   -q

    quiet, don't display status or any other output while running

  --rate   -r

    frame rate per second, whatever your card can do, 44100 is CD
    quality.  Higher rates are beneficial on binaurals at high
    frequencies, say 15000 Hz and above, or very low beats, < 0.1.
    For normal frequencies, 44100 will be just fine.  
    
    Examples 
      --rate=44100 
      -r 96000


  --write   -w

    write to this file instead of the default, playing via the sound
    card

    Examples
      --write=/home/xkdi/mindblowing.flac
      -w  /home/xkdi/mindblowing.wav

  CONFIGURATION FILE

  Any text after a # is disregarded, whether at the start of a line or
  after meaningful text.

  Options may be set in a configuration file, in fact it is easier to
  do so, but they must be before any time sequences in that file.

  A time sequence may span multiple lines, but a voice (binaural,
  bell, noise, etc.)  cannot be split across lines.

  Time Sequences

  A time sequence always starts with a duration in the format
  hh:mm:ss.  This may be followed with a fade indicator of less than
  sign "<" for fade in or greater than sign ">" for fade out. e.g.
  00:02:03''''< means to fade in for 2 minutes and 3 seconds.  The
  duration is followed by the voices that will play during that time
  period.

  Separators allowed are | , ; ' =, multiples are allowed mixed with
  singles, any combination of separators even within a voice.
  However, every voice must be joined by separators.  No white space
  is allowed.
  
  The greater than sign ">" after a binaural or chronaural voice is a
  slide, and will continuously adjust carrier, beat, amplitude,
  amplitude beat and amplitude variation to be the next binaural or
  chronaural at the end of the time period.  For slides to work, the
  binaural or chronaural voices must be in the same relative position
  in the time sequences.  There is no other way to know that there is
  a link between the voices.  So the first voice in the sequence will
  always look to the first voice in the next sequence to slide to,
  etc.

  One alternative slide format is the step slide.  Instead of using a
  greater than sign ">" to indicate a slide, use an ampersand "&".
  Instead of sliding smoothly to the next time sequence, the slide
  will occur in a series of steps with slides between them.  The
  ampersand is followed by three fields separated by separators:
  number of steps, time for slide joins and fuzz.  Number of steps is
  the number of step-slide sequences that you want in the time period.
  The time for slide join is how long to make the slides that bridge
  the steps in seconds.  And the fuzz is the percent of the interval
  that the constant tone can occur in, if it is 10 per cent, then it
  will be the fixed frequence +/- 5 per cent.  The time for slide join
  determines the length of the constant step as the total time for the
  period minus all of the slides has to equal the number of steps.
  The first step or constant tone is always the starting frequency.
  Time to entrain varies and you should make sure that the step time
  is above this for you.  For some, this will work better than a
  continuous slide.

  Another alternative slide format is the vary slide.  Instead of
  using a greater than sign ">" to indicate a slide, use a tilde "~".
  Instead of sliding smoothly to the next time sequence, the slide
  will occur in a series of steps with slides between them.  The tilde
  is followed by two fields separated by separators:  number of steps
  and time for slide joins.  Number of steps is the number of
  step-slide sequences that you want in the time period.  The time for
  slide join is how long to make the slides that bridge the steps in
  seconds.  The time for slide join determines the length of the
  constant step as the total time for the period minus all of the
  slides has to equal the number of steps.  The first step or constant
  tone is always the starting frequency.  Time to entrain varies and
  you should make sure that the step time is above this for you.  This
  varies from the step slide in that the steps are random in their
  ordering; they can be anywhere between the starting voice and the
  voice being slid to.  The last slide will always be to the
  corresponding voice of the next time sequence.  This is a great way
  to experience a lot of frequencies in a range.

  All amplitudes are in percentages, 0 is none, 100 is max.  

  All splits are expressed as fraction for left channel.  e.g. .3
  means .3 left channel, .7 right channel 
  
  All durations in voices are expressed as seconds.  e.g. .3 = .3
  second, 20 = 20 seconds, 1200 = 20 minutes 

  For any fields with a minimum and maximum range, setting them the
  same makes it a constant value.  Any time they are different, a
  random selection in the range will be made.

  Fields for binaural are name, carrier frequency, beat frequency, and
  amplitude.  Optional fields are a left and right amplitude frequency
  variation and a left and right percentage to vary.  Optional fields
  must be at the end, before the slide indicator if they are present.
  The + or - on the beat frequency indicates whether the left ear is
  higher + or lower -.  The beat is centered on the carrier frequency,
  so 200  +4 results in L 202 and R 198.

  Fields for chronaural are name, carrier, amplitude, amplitude beat,
  amplitude fraction, amplitude behave, beginning split, ending split,
  lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, split beat, and slide.
  Amplitude beat is the frequency through time of the carrier tone.
  Amplitude fraction is the value the sin function has to have before
  the tone is played.  Behavior for amp beat is as follows:
  1 sin wave  tone is adjusted by sin value 
  2 square wave  tone is either on or off 
  3 dirac delta approximation  power of sin 
  If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly
  between lowest split and highest split.  Split beat is the frequency
  through time of the oscillation of the left and right split.  Slide
  must be > or no slide will occur.
  Example
             carrier                begin split                 slide
               |                       |                            |

  Fields for bell are name, frequency, minimum start amplitude, maximum
  start amplitude, beginning split, ending split, lowest split allowed,
  highest split allowed, minimum time allowed to ring, maximum time
  allowed to ring, minimum time till next ring, maximum time till next
  ring, and decay pattern for the ring, 1 through 5.  
  1 decrease linearly to 0 
  2 decrease linearly to .5, 
  3 constant, 
  4 increase linearly to 1.1 
  5 decrease quadratically to 0  (this is the most natural sounding) 
  The minimum and maximum time till next play are relative to the
  beginning of the last play. i.e. unlike noise, bell will interrupt
  itself.  The bell can start ringing again before the current ring
  has finished.  It displaces the currently ringing bell.  If
  beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly
  between lowest split and highest split.
  Example
      frequency        begin split   high split  max time        decay
        |                  |              |         |                |

      separators   max amp   end split     min time             

  Fields for noise are name, minimum start frequency, maximum start
  frequency, minimum start amplitude, maximum start amplitude, beginning
  split, ending split, lowest split allowed, highest split allowed,
  minimum time allowed to play, maximum time allowed to play, minimum
  time till next play, maximum time till next play, minimum decay
  pattern for the play, 1 through 5.  maximum decay pattern for the
  play, 1 through 5, and the number of repeats.  
  1 decrease linearly to 0 
  2 decrease linearly to .5, 
  3 constant, 
  4 increase linearly to 1.1 
  5 decrease linearly  to 1.25 
  If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly
  between lowest split and highest split.  Minimum decay has to be
  less than maximum decay or unpredicable behavior results.  The
  minimum and maximum time till next play are relative to the end of
  the last play. i.e. unlike bell, noise will never interrupt itself.
  The next voice in a slot will never start playing until after the
  current voice has finished.  If there is no repeat on the end, 1 is
  the default.

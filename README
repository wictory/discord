discord is a program that allows you to program binaural and chronaural beats with great flexibility and mixed with sound
files of your choice.  The flexibility requires some complexibility.  There is a learning curve.  Use the test configuration
files as templates and experiment with changing the variables to see the effects.  There are help files in text and html
format.

This was developed on a Fedora Core 6 linux system.  It requires libsndfile and libsamplerate.  If your distro does not
provide them, go to http://www.mega-nerd.com for the latest versions.

To compile:
./mkd

Install manually wherever you want it.  Single executable, discord.  Alternatively, just run as ./discord.

If you want to port to another architecture, the engine should work just fine.  However the dependencies on the sound system
alsa will have to be replaced and the pthread calls will have to be changed to the threading model on the new platform.  They
can optionally be removed as they are only scavenging a few cycles for sound creation, and under light usage will make no
difference.  libsndfile and libsamplerate are compatible across multiple platforms.

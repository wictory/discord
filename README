discord is a program that allows you to program binaural and
chronaural beats with great flexibility and mixed with sound files of
your choice.  The flexibility requires some complexity.  There is a
learning curve.  Use the test script files as templates and experiment
with changing the variables to see the effects.  There is a help file
in text and html format and a man page.

This was developed on a Fedora Core 6/7 linux system.  It requires
libsndfile and libsamplerate.  Both the library and the development
package that includes the header files have to be installed.  If your
distro does not provide them, go to http://www.mega-nerd.com for the
latest versions.  The library libFLAC must be present for libsndfile
to have FLAC capability.  If it was compiled without the library
present and you try to use FLAC, discord will abort saying unable to
open file.  The beta of libsndfile 1.0.18 provides built in FLAC
support, but you will need Octave installed to run it.  If you 
cannot get FLAC to work you can always use wav and then convert it 
to FLAC using sox or audacity.

discord now uses the standard GNU autotools mechanism to install.

To unpack:
tar -jxvf discord-1.#.#.tar.bz2

Change to the directory discord-1.#.#.

To compile:

./configure

make

su make install

exit

It should be a clean compile. 

If you install with the default prefix, all of the discord information
will be in directory /usr/local/share/discord.  The binary will be in
/usr/local/bin and the man page in /usr/local/share/man/man1.

A sample configuration file called discordrc is provided for your
$HOME directory.  It allows you to have minimal script files, just the
sequences, if you want, using the options from the configuration file
to play. Copy it to your home directory as .discordrc and tune to your
satisfaction. 

If discord compiles fine but won't run, look at one of the alsa-lib
workaround files included.  The html version is also available on the
discord project web site at sourceforge.net.  The short explanation is
that the alsa-lib version 1.0.14 final does not support floating point
formats.  As doubles are the format that discord uses, discord will
not work with alsa-lib 1.0.14.  

There can also be issues with OSS based sound servers as they don't
allow other applications to run.  In this case discord will fall
back to the default plugin using its fixed frame rate of 48000.

discord is a program that allows you to program binaural and
chronaural beats with great flexibility and mixed with sound files of
your choice.  The flexibility requires some complexity.  There is a
learning curve.  Use the test script files as templates and experiment
with changing the variables to see the effects.  There is a help file
in text format.

This was developed on a Fedora Core 6/7 linux system.  It requires
libsndfile and libsamplerate.  If your distro does not provide them,
go to http://www.mega-nerd.com for the latest versions.  The library
libFLAC must be present for libsndfile to have FLAC capability.  If it
was compiled without the library present and you try to use FLAC, it
will abort with no indication of why. 

To compile:
./mkd

Install manually wherever you want it.  Single executable, discord.
Alternatively, just run as ./discord.

A sample configuration file called .discordrc is provided for your
$HOME directory.  It allows you to have minimal script files, just the
sequences, if you want, using the options from the configuration file
to play.  

If you want to port to another architecture, the engine should work
just fine.  However the dependencies on the sound system alsa will
have to be replaced and the pthread calls will have to be changed to
the threading model on the new platform.  They can optionally be
removed as they are only scavenging a few cycles for sound creation,
and under light usage will make no difference.  libsndfile and
libsamplerate are compatible across multiple platforms.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="NAVY">DESCRIPTION</FONT></STRONG>

<P>  discord is a command line program used to generate binaural and
  chronaural beats mixed with tones, noise, or sound files of the
  users choice.  The default is to play the files via the computer's
  sound card, but they can be written to output files instead.  Only
  file formats available in libsndfile can be used as input.  Those
  formats do not include mp3 or ogg at this time, though the creator
  of libsndfile is thinking about adding ogg.  He is not adding mp3
  because of patent issues.  For practical purposes, this means wav,
  flac, or raw files on a PC, though au and aiff formats are also
  available.  If an input sound file has a different sample rate than
  that selected for the output, it will automatically be resampled to
  the requested rate.  A copy can be retained in the same directory as
  it was found with the new rate appended to the filename.  Output
  file types are limited to wav, flac, and raw; these are all lossless
  formats.

<P>  While all of the options below can be used on the command line, the
  sequences to play must be defined in a script file.  Options on the command
  line override options in a script file.  Script files are named with a
  .discord extension by convention.  You can, however, use whatever name you
  want for your script files.  All of the options can also be set in a
  configuration file in your home directory called .discordrc.  This file
  contains options identical to those in a script file or on the command line.
  The options found here have the lowest priority and will be overridden by
  either a script file or the command line.  There is a sample .discordrc
  included, so you can move it to your $HOME directory if you want.

<P>  There are eight voice types in discord.  These are binaural,
  chronaural, bell, noise, stoch (stands for stochastic), sample,
  repeat, and once.

<P>  Voice type description

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#FF7F00>binaural</FONT></STRONG>

<P>  Generate a pair of tones separated by a beat frequency at a specific
  carrier frequency and amplitude.  Optionally vary the amplitude of
  the left and right channels at a specified frequency and by a
  specified percent.  Binaural tones are allowed to slide into the
  next binaural on carrier, beat, amplitude, amplitude beat, and
  amplitude amount.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#FF7F00>chronaural</FONT></STRONG>

<P>  Generate a periodic tone at a specified frequency and amplitude.
  The period is the beat in this case.  In addition, the split or pan
  of the tone can be specified to vary between set values at a rate
  specified.  Chronaural tones are allowed to slide into the next
  chronaural on carrier, beat, amplitude, and split beat.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#FF7F00>bell</FONT></STRONG>

<P>  Generate a tone at a specified frequency and amplitude.  The tone
  may be fixed periodic or occur at randomly generated times between
  selected upper and lower limits.  Decay or enhance for the tone can
  also be set.  Bells can interrupt each other before they are
  finished playing.  No slide is available for bell.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#FF7F00>noise</FONT></STRONG>

<P>  Generate a group of tones within a specified frequency and amplitude
  range.  The tones may be fixed periodic or occur at randomly
  generated times between selected upper and lower limits.  Decay or
  enhance for the tone can also be set.  Noise tones don't interrupt
  each other before they are finished playing.  No slide is available
  for noise.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#FF7F00>stoch</FONT></STRONG>

<P>  Play a user supplied sound file at either fixed intervals or random
  intervals within specified times.  Pan and amplitude can vary for
  each play, or remain fixed depending on options specified.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#FF7F00>sample</FONT></STRONG>

<P>  Play a randomly selected fixed time slices of a user supplied sound
  file continuously.  Pan and amplitude can vary with each sample or
  remain fixed, depending on the options specified.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#FF7F00>repeat</FONT></STRONG>

<P>  Play a user supplied sound file continuously.  Pan and amplitude can
  vary with each repeat or remain fixed, depending on the options
  specified.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#FF7F00>once</FONT></STRONG>

<P>  Play a user supplied sound file once at a specified time.  Pan and
  amplitude can be randomly chosen or be fixed, depending on the
  options specified.

<P>  All internal processing is done in double format so the tones are
  very precise. The user specified sound files are stored in memory,
  so you should have lots of memory or use small sound files.  They
  are stored only once, no matter how many times they occur in the 
  sequence file.

<P>  To give you a feel for what this is describing, below is a link
  to a file generated with discord.  It is about 7 minutes long.  If you
  don't have a fast connection, you should download it before listening.
  In order to get the effect you will have to use headphones as this
  file is pure binaural.  It is not a beginner file.  It uses some lower
  carrier frequencies, it slides quickly, and it doesn't give much time
  for entrainment.  It also starts in middle alpha and goes to low alpha
  and back to middle alpha.  And the amp beat is at only .5 per second.
  However you will be able to hear the amp beat occurring every two
  seconds, and you can also hear the binaural beat by lifting first one
  cup of the headphones, and hearing only a tone in the other ear.  Then
  let that cup down and lift the other cup.  You will again hear only a
  tone in the other ear.  When you put both down at once you will 'hear'
  a sound in the middle of your head, in this case at 10 beats per
  second to 8 beats per second.  That is the binaural beat.  You will
  know you entrained successfully if at the end of the sequence you feel
  charged, and everything has a slight glow.  You might feel a change in
  your state of consciousness without the effects if you don't fully
  entrain.  If you feel no change, that is all right.  You do have the
  ability to entrain, it will just take practice.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://discord.sourceforge.net/good_morning.wav">sample wav sound file from discord 70MiB</A>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="NAVY">OPTIONS</FONT></STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-a, --audio_device</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    Specify the audio device to use for playback in alsa plug format.
    Discord will automatically create a plughw alsa plugin from the
    default audio device if this is not specified.  Discord uses alsa to
    do format conversion from internal program representation to what the
    card requires, but locks the sample rates to be only those supported
    by the card hardware.  This prevents resampling with consequent
    distortion and slowdown.  If you try to use a direct hardware link
    like "hw:0,0" here it will cause a segmentation fault.  To implement
    direct hardware writing discord would have to incorporate all of the
    format conversion.  This seems counterproductive.  The first number is
    the card number, the second is the device number, both starting at 0.
    See the alsa documentation at <A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/">www.alsa-project.org</A> for a fuller
    explanation.
    
<P>    Examples
<PRE>
      --audio_device=plughw:0,0  
      -a plughw:0,2
</PRE>
<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-b, --bit_accuracy</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    bit accuracy of sound generated, 16i, 24i, 32i, 32f, 64f, i=int and
    f=float.  Only applies if you are sending to a file.
    
<P>    Examples
<PRE>
      --bit_accuracy=16i
      -b 24i
</PRE>
<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-c, --compensate</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    compensate for human hearing, low and high freqs need to be
    louder, max 32 adjustment points are allowed.  The compensation
    points can all be on the same line or on multiple lines, but each
    line must start with the option name.  If this is correct, a sound
    at the compensated frequency sounds the same loudness as any other
    sound at its compensated frequency.  i.e. It linearizes the range.
    This is individual, depends on your hearing, so the above is only
    a starting point for you to play with and tweak.  For most people,
    sounds from about 800 Hz to 4000 Hz are the loudest and about
    equivalent.  Hearing falls off at either end so that the amplitude
    has to be higher in order for the sound to have the same loudness
    to the ear.  There is dispute about whether sounds outside the
    range of hearing have any effect.  If you use compensation, set
    all amplitudes to a constant value for binaural, chronaural, bell,
    and noise.  Or whatever ratio between the loudness you want them
    to have, as if linear.  The stoch, sample, repeat, and once voices
    are not compensated so should be set at the amplitude you want.

<P>    Examples  (see also the test script files)
<PRE>
      --compensate=5=9'''3000=1'''',13000=3,,,,20000=11.0
      -c 5=10'''2530=1''',13128=3.5,,,,20000=10.0
</PRE>
<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-d, --display_only</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    display only, don't actually play any sequences

<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-e, --every</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    display status every x seconds, integer &gt;= 1.

<P>    Examples
<PRE>
      --every=10   
      -e 5
</PRE>
<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-f, --fast</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    fast, move through at multiple of time, 60 ==&gt; 1min becomes 1 sec
    so a 1 hour play sequence will play in 1 minute.  Good for
    testing a new sequence for correctness, though obviously the
    effect won't be the same.  Bell has been tweaked so that the pitch
    doesn't change while using this.

<P>    Examples
<PRE>
      --fast=60
      -f 10
</PRE>
<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-h, --help</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    help

<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-k, --keep</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    keep any files generated by resampling.  Default is to delete the
    files when they are no longer needed.

<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-o, --out_format</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    output file format, w:wav, f:flac, r:raw

<P>    Examples
<PRE>
      --out_format=w
      -o w
</PRE>
<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-q, --quiet</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    quiet, don't display status or any other output while running

<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-r, --rate</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    frame rate per second, whatever your card can do, 44100 is CD
    quality.  Higher rates are beneficial on binaurals at high
    frequencies, say 15000 Hz and above, or very low beats, &lt; 0.1.
    For normal frequencies, 44100 will be just fine.  
    
<P>    Examples 
<PRE>
      --rate=44100 
      -r 96000
</PRE>
 <P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-t, --thread</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    use nonblocking thread to play sound instead of a blocking
    function call.  This allows more throughput, but because the
    thread runs with user priority, during heavy cpu usage it can
    result in breaks in the sound while other tasks block it.  The
    blocking function call is more robust in this situation.  Under
    light usage, either is fine.  This does not affect the threads
    used for writing a file or displaying the status while running.

<P><DT><STRONG><FONT COLOR=#DB9370>-w, --write</FONT></STRONG><DD>

<P>    write to this file instead of the default, playing via the sound
    card

<P>    Examples

      -w  /home/xkdi/mindblowing.wav

</DL>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="NAVY">CONFIGURATION</FONT> FILE</STRONG>

<P>  You may optionally place a configuration file called .discordrc in
  your $HOME directory.  It may contain only options, in the same
  format as in a script file or on the command line.  These options
  will be overridden by a script file or the command line.  A sample
  is provided.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="NAVY">SCRIPT</FONT> FILE</STRONG>

<P>  Any text after a # is disregarded, whether at the start of a line or
  after meaningful text.

<P>  Options may be set in a script file, in fact it is easier to
  do so, but they must be before any time sequences in that file.

<P>  A time sequence may span multiple lines, but a voice (binaural,
  bell, noise, etc.)  cannot be split across lines.

<P><STRONG>Time Sequences</STRONG>

<P>  A time sequence always starts with a duration in the format
  hh:mm:ss.  This may be followed with a fade indicator of less than
  sign "&lt;" for fade in or greater than sign "&gt;" for fade out. e.g.
  00:02:03''''&lt; means to fade in for 2 minutes and 3 seconds.  The
  duration is followed by the voices that will play during that time
  period.

<P>  Separators allowed are | , ; ' =, multiples are allowed mixed with
  singles, any combination of separators even within a voice.
  However, every voice must be joined by separators.  No white space
  is allowed.
  
<P>  The greater than sign "&gt;" after a binaural or chronaural voice is a
  slide, and will continuously adjust carrier, beat, amplitude,
  amplitude beat and amplitude variation to be the next binaural or
  chronaural at the end of the time period.  For slides to work, the
  binaural or chronaural voices must be in the same relative position
  in the time sequences.  There is no other way to know that there is
  a link between the voices.  So the first voice in the sequence will
  always look to the first voice in the next sequence to slide to,
  etc.

<P>  One alternative slide format is the step slide.  Instead of using a
  greater than sign "&gt;" to indicate a slide, use an ampersand "&amp;".
  Instead of sliding smoothly to the next time sequence, the slide
  will occur in a series of steps with slides between them.  The
  ampersand is followed by three fields separated by separators:
  number of steps, time for slide joins and fuzz.  Number of steps is
  the number of step-slide sequences that you want in the time period.
  The time for slide join is how long to make the slides that bridge
  the steps in seconds.  And the fuzz is the percent of the interval
  that the constant tone can occur in, if it is 10 per cent, then it
  will be the fixed frequence +/- 5 per cent.  The time for slide join
  determines the length of the constant step as the total time for the
  period minus all of the slides has to equal the number of steps.
  The first step or constant tone is always the starting frequency.
  Time to entrain varies and you should make sure that the step time
  is above this for you.  For some, this will work better than a
  continuous slide.

<P>  Another alternative slide format is the vary slide.  Instead of
  using a greater than sign "&gt;" to indicate a slide, use a tilde "~".
  Instead of sliding smoothly to the next time sequence, the slide
  will occur in a series of steps with slides between them.  The tilde
  is followed by two fields separated by separators:  number of steps
  and time for slide joins.  Number of steps is the number of
  step-slide sequences that you want in the time period.  The time for
  slide join is how long to make the slides that bridge the steps in
  seconds.  The time for slide join determines the length of the
  constant step as the total time for the period minus all of the
  slides has to equal the number of steps.  The first step or constant
  tone is always the starting frequency.  Time to entrain varies and
  you should make sure that the step time is above this for you.  This
  varies from the step slide in that the steps are random in their
  ordering; they can be anywhere between the starting voice and the
  voice being slid to.  The last slide will always be to the
  corresponding voice of the next time sequence.  This is a great way
  to experience a lot of frequencies in a range.

<P>  All amplitudes are in percentages, 0 is none, 100 is max.  

<P>  All splits are expressed as fraction for left channel.  e.g. .3
  means .3 left channel, .7 right channel 
  
<P>  All durations in voices are expressed as seconds.  e.g. .3 = .3
  second, 20 = 20 seconds, 1200 = 20 minutes 

<P>  For any fields with a minimum and maximum range, setting them the
  same makes it a constant value.  Any time they are different, a
  random selection in the range will be made.

<P>  Fields for <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#FF7F00>binaural</FONT></STRONG> are name, carrier frequency, beat frequency, and
  amplitude.  Optional fields are a left and right amplitude frequency
  variation and a left and right percentage to vary.  Optional fields
  must be at the end, before the slide indicator if they are present.
  The + or - on the beat frequency indicates whether the left ear is
  higher + or lower -.  The beat is centered on the carrier frequency,
  so 200  +4 results in L 202 and R 198.

</PRE>

<P>  Fields for <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#FF7F00>chronaural</FONT></STRONG> 
  are name, carrier, amplitude, amplitude beat,
  amplitude fraction, amplitude behave, beginning split, ending split,
  lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, split beat, and slide.
  Amplitude beat is the frequency through time of the carrier tone.
  Amplitude fraction is the value the sin function has to have
  before the tone is played, [0.0, 1.0).  The closer this is to 1.0, the
  shorter the tone will be.  There is a twenty-five frame fade in and
  fade out on all chronaural tones to prevent crackle in the sound
  stream so you cannot use an amplitude fraction such that the length of
  the tone is less than fifty frames or it will not sound.
  e.g. at a frame rate of 48000/sec and chronaural beat frequency of
  20 Hz the maximum amplitude fraction is slightly above 0.9975.
  at a frame rate of 96000/sec and chronaural beat frequency of
  5 Hz the maximum amplitude fraction is slightly above 0.9999.
  Behavior for amp beat is as follows:

<P>  1 sin wave - tone is multiplied by sin value <BR>
  2 square wave - tone is either on or off <BR>
  3 dirac delta approximation - tone is multiplied by fifth power of sin <BR>
  4 extreme dirac delta approximation - tone is multiplied by fifteenth power of sin 

<P>  If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly
  between lowest split and highest split.  Split beat is the frequency
  through time of the oscillation of the left and right split.  Slide
  indicator must be present or no slide will occur.

<P>  Fields for <STRONG><FONT COLOR=#FF7F00>bell</FONT></STRONG> are name, frequency, minimum start amplitude, maximum

<P>  If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between
  lowest split and highest split.  Minimum decay has to be less than maximum
  decay or unpredicable behavior results.  The minimum and maximum time till
  next play are relative to the end of the last play. i.e. unlike bell, noise
  will never interrupt itself.  The next voice in a slot will never start
  playing until after the current voice has finished.  If there is no repeat
  on the end, 1 is the default.  To reduce crackle there is a 25 frame fade in
  and fade out on the noise voice.

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="NAVY">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</FONT></STRONG>
<DL>
<DT>  <STRONG>Q</STRONG> Why is the program called discord?</DT>
<P>
<DD>  <STRONG>A</STRONG>  Because binaural beats are mental artifacts created by a
  discordancy between what the left and right ears hear.</DD>
<P>
<DT>  <STRONG>Q</STRONG>  Why do I call it chronaural beat?</DT>
<P>
<DD>  <STRONG>A</STRONG>  Chron for time and aural for sound.  The beat comes via sounds
  distributed in the time dimension, thus chronaural.</DD>

<P><DT>  <STRONG>Q</STRONG>  Do the exact frequencies matter?</DT>

<P><DD>  <STRONG>A</STRONG>  In my opinion they do not.  Because everyone is unique, the
  specific frequencies that give someone else an effect might not have
  the same effect for you.  General frequency ranges do correspond
  with similar effects in different people, so I think it is better to
  experience many different frequencies in a range.  That is why there
  is randomness available in the voices.  You never have to listen to
  the same sequence twice, though you can.</DD>

<P><DT>  <STRONG>Q</STRONG>  Does it matter when you listen to the beats?</DT>

<P><DD>  <STRONG>A</STRONG>  No.  However, it is easiest to listen for longer periods of time
  in the evening as entrainment tends to relax you and this is a time
  when there aren't any urgent matters pending.  It also gives you the
  rest of the night to process.</DD>

<P><DT>  <STRONG>Q</STRONG>  Does the loudness of the beats matter?</DT>

<P><DD>  <STRONG>A</STRONG>  Not really.  Some like them below the threshold of noticeable
  hearing, some like them just audible, some like them loud.  Whatever
  you feel comfortable with is the right loudness.</DD>

<P><DT>  <STRONG>Q</STRONG>  Are beats better with or without accompaniment?</DT>

<P><DD>  <STRONG>A</STRONG>  Again, this is a matter of personal taste.  However you feel
  comfortable listening is the right way.</DD>

<P><DT>  <STRONG>Q</STRONG>  Which is better, binaural or chronaural beats?</DT>

<P><DD>  <STRONG>A</STRONG>  Research I've seen on the internet suggests that chronaural beats
  are much more effective than binaural beats.  Personally, I like
  mixing them and find both effective with a preference for binaural.
  Try for yourself.</DD>

<P><DT>  <STRONG>Q</STRONG>  What is the maximum amount you should listen per day?</DT>

<P><DD>  <STRONG>A</STRONG>  This is individual.  For some, an hour a day will bring on
  overwhelm.  For others, two hours a day will be just fine.  Start
  with half an hour to an hour.  Then if you want to listen more,
  adjust by a half hour a day.  Because listening makes you feel good,
  you will want to listen as much as possible.  And this is OK as long
  as it doesn't lead to overwhelm.  I find that if I listen too much I
  stop wanting to listen at all.</DD>

<P><DT>  <STRONG>Q</STRONG>  How does this work?</DT>

<P><DD>  <STRONG>A</STRONG>  I'll give you my opinion, but you should search the web and come
  to your own conclusions.  I think that by triggering waves of
  neurons firing in the brain you do two things: stimulate stored
  memories that haven't been accessed recently and trigger the brain
  to create new neuronal links.  By accessing old memories through new
  pathways and creating new pathways for processing you alter the
  emotional content of memories and allow your brain to integrate
  those memories differently.  This also increases the processing
  power of your brain and makes it/you more flexible.</DD>

<P><DT>  <STRONG>Q</STRONG>  Is there a best way to do this?</DT>

<P><DD>  <STRONG>A</STRONG>  Remember, this is all my opinion.  I
  think two general rules apply.  If you are less experienced it will
  take you longer to entrain with any given beat, and slides have to be
  slower for your brain to follow along.  If you are less experienced it
  is easier for you to entrain with higher carriers and higher beats.
  As you gain experience you are able to utilize lower carriers and
  lower beats, and use faster slides.  These are general rules and might
  not apply to you.  Experiment.  It is good to mix it up, entrain with
  lots of different frequencies rather than any specific frequency.  It
  is the repetition and the beat range that matter and every little bit
  of listening adds to your skill.  Lots of people seem to gain benefit
  from listening to the same sequence for long periods of time, though,
  so I could be wrong.  This is a new frontier with lots of exploration
  yet to be done, and all of the above could just be part of a larger
  picture not yet discovered.</DD>

<P><DT>  <STRONG>Q</STRONG>  That EFT thing seems kind of flaky.  Talk to me.</DT>

<P><DD>  <STRONG>A</STRONG>  Think of your brain as an operating system.  The pattern of your
  current situation is used as a fuzzy key into a hash table looking
  for a response.  All hits are stored in a list.  The scheduler scans
  the list looking for the closest match with the highest emotional
  intensity.  The preconfigured response for that match is run.  If
  there are no hits on the hash table then logic is used to figure out
  what to do.  What EFT does is change the scheduling priority for a
  memory.  It does this by having the memory loaded/active and then
  reducing (the tapping) the charge on the emotion.  My theory is that
  the tapping points are like direct lines into your neural machinery,
  and allow you to 'turn the knobs' that lower the intensity.  The
  good part of this is that you aren't actually in the situation so
  you can deal with the response a lot better.

  <P>Brain wave entrainment bypasses the lookup and triggers unrelated
  memories directly in a random manner, thus diffusing the response.
  The memory isn't changed, the meaning of it is transformed.  In
  future when the memory is accessed through the scheduler, it is
  different because of this random triggering.  Occasionally, the
  random triggering might cause a repressed memory to become
  accessible for scheduling before it has had its response altered.
  That is when you need a technique to remove the emotional intensity.

  <P>If you just can't get EFT working for you, if it is just too far
  outside your belief system to use, here are some other methods that
  do the same thing in different ways and are effective.

  <P>1. The Sedona Method.<BR>
  2. Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).<BR>
  3. Hypnosis.<BR>
  4. Clean language.<BR>
  5. Core transformation.

  <P>Once you understand the way the brain processes experience it is not
  EFT that seems flaky but conventional therapies.  They don't address
  the cause of the problem, the emotional intensity, but instead try
  to get you to 'understand it'.  Maybe this will reduce the emotional
  intensity through some chance happening, but probably won't.  In all
  likelihood the problem actually becomes worse, because you are
  triggering the response over and over and over so you get really
  good at it.  Thus you end up being in therapy for years with no
  resolution.  EFT or the above alternatives take anywhere from
  seconds/minutes through hours to weeks and address the actual
  problem, the emotional intensity, directly.  Once they work the
  problem is gone.</DD>

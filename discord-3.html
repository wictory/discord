<P>discord is a command line program used to generate binaural and chronaural beats mixed with tones, noise, or sound files of
the users choice.  The default is to play the files via the computer's sound card, but they can be written to output files
instead.  Only file formats available in libsndfile can be used.  Those formats do not include mp3 or ogg at this time,
though the creator of libsndfile is thinking about adding ogg.  He is not adding mp3 because of patent issues.  For practical
purposes, this means wav, flac, or raw files on a PC, though au and aiff formats are also available.  If an input sound file
has a different sample rate than that selected for the output, it will automatically resampled to the requested rate, and a
copy will be written in the same directory as it was found with the new rate appended to the filename.</P>
<P>While all of the options below can be used on the command line, the sequences to play must be defined in a
configuration file.  Configuration files are named with a .discord extension by convention.  You can, however, use whatever
name you want for your configuration files.  </P>
<P>There are eight voice types in discord.  These are binaural, chronaural, bell, noise, stoch (stands for stochastic), sample,
repeat, and once.</P>

</H2>



<H3><B>binaural</B></H3>

<P>Generate a pair of tones separated by a beat frequency at a specific carrier frequency and amplitude.
Optionally vary the amplitude of the left and right channels at a specified frequency and by a specified percent.  Binaural
tones are allowed to slide into the next binaural on carrier, beat, amplitude, amplitude beat, and amplitude amount.</P>

<H3><B>chronaural</B> </H3>

<P>Generate a periodic tone at a specified frequency and amplitude.  The period is the beat in this case.
In addition, the split or pan of the tone can be specified to vary between set values at a rate specified.  Chronaural tones
are allowed to slide into the next chronaural on carrier, beat, amplitude, and split beat.</P>

<H3><B>bell</B> </H3>

<P>Generate a tone at a specified frequency and amplitude.  The tone may be fixed periodic or occur at randomly
generated times between selected upper and lower limits.  Decay or enhance for the tone can also be set.  Bells can interrupt
each other before they are finished playing.  No slide is available for bell.</P>

<H3><B>noise</B> </H3>

<P>Generate a group of tones within a specified frequency and amplitude range.  The tones may be fixed periodic
or occur at randomly generated times between selected upper and lower limits.  Decay or enhance for the tone can also be set.
Noise tones don't interrupt each other before they are finished playing.  No slide is available for noise.</P>

<H3><B>stoch</B> </H3>

<P>Play a user supplied sound file at either fixed intervals or random intervals within specified times.  Pan
and amplitude can vary for each play, or remain fixed depending on options specified.</P>

<H3><B>sample</B> </H3>

<P>Play a randomly selected fixed time slices of a user supplied sound file continuously.  Pan and amplitude
can vary with each sample or remain fixed, depending on the options specified.</P>

<H3><B>repeat</B> </H3>

<P>Play a user supplied sound file continuously.  Pan and amplitude can vary with each repeat or remain fixed,
depending on the options specified.</P>

<H3><B>once</B> </H3>

<P>Play a user supplied sound file once at a specified time.  Pan and amplitude can be randomly chosen or be
fixed, depending on the options specified.</P>
<P>All internal processing is done in double format so the tones are very precise. The user specified sound files are stored in
memory, so you should have lots of memory or use small sound files.  </P>

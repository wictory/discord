#      case 'c':  // Compensate for human hearing, low and high freqs need to be louder
#                    to have the same subjective loudness to the human ear.
#                    If this is set correctly, a sound at the compensated frequency
#                    sounds the same loudness as any other sound at its
#                    compensated frequency.  i.e. It linearizes the range
#                    This is individual, depends on your hearing, so the below is only a starting
#                    point for you to play with and tweak.  It has a max of 32 points.
#                    There is some dispute whether sounds outside the range of hearing
#                    have any effect.  Of course, that is dependent on
#                    whether those sounds even get to your ears through the system.  This
#                    applies to the internally generated sounds: binaural, chronaural, bell, noise.
#                    If you use compensation, set all amplitudes to a fixed value.
#                    Or whatever ratio between the loudness you want them to have, as if linear.
#                    The stochastic, sample, repeat and once voices are not compensated so should be
#                    set at the amplitude you want.

#  A time sequence may span multiple lines, but a voice (binaural, bell, noise, etc.)
#  cannot be split across lines.
#
#  Time Sequences
#
#  Separators allowed are | , ; ' =, multiples are allowed mixed with singles, any combination
#  of separators even within a voice.
#  However, every voice must be joined by separators.  No white space is allowed.
#  The < or > after the duration/time is a fade in <, or fade out > for that time sequence.
#  The > after a binaural voice is a slide, and will adjust to be the next binaural at the
#  end of the time period.
#  All amplitudes are in percentages, 0 is none, 100 is max.
#  All splits are expressed as fraction for Left channel.  e.g. .3 means .3 left channel, .7 right channel
#  All durations in voices are expressed as seconds.  e.g. .3 = .3 second, 20 = 20 seconds, 1200 = 20 minutes
#  For any fields with a minimum and maximum range, setting them the same makes it a constant value.  Any time 
#    they are different, a random selection in the range will be made.
#
#  Fields for binaural are name, carrier frequency, beat frequency, amplitude.
#    Optional fields are a left and right amplitude frequency variation and a left and right percentage to vary.
#    Must be at the end, before the slide indicator if they are present.
#    The + or - on the beat frequency indicates whether the left ear is higher + or lower -.
#    The beat is centered on the carrier frequency, so 200  +4 results in L 202 and R 198.
#    Slide must be > or no slide will occur.
#
#  Fields for bell are name, frequency, minimum start amplitude, maximum start amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
#    lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, minimum time allowed to ring, maximum time allowed to ring,
#    minimum time till next ring, maximum time till next ring, and decay pattern for the ring, 1 through 5.
#    1 decrease linearly to 0
#    2 decrease linearly to .5, 
#    3 constant,
#    4 increase linearly to 1.1
#    5 decrease quadratically to 0  (this is the most natural sounding)
#    The minimum and maximum time till next play are relative to the beginning of the last play. i.e. unlike noise,
#      bell will interrupt itself.  The bell can start ringing again before the current ring has finished.  
#      It displaces the currently ringing bell.
#    If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.
#
#  Fields for noise are name, minimum start frequency, maximum start frequency, minimum start amplitude, 
#    maximum start amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
#    lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, minimum time allowed to play, maximum time allowed to play,
#    minimum time till next play, maximum time till next play, minimum decay pattern for the play, 1 through 5.
#    maximum decay pattern for the play, 1 through 5, and the number of repeats.
#    1 decrease linearly to 0
#    2 decrease linearly to .5, 
#    3 constant,
#    4 increase linearly to 1.1
#    5 decrease linearly  to 1.25
#    If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.
#    Minimum decay has to be less than maximum decay or unpredicable behavior results.
#    The minimum and maximum time till next play are relative to the end of the last play. i.e. unlike bell,
#      noise will never interrupt itself.  The next voice in a slot will never start playing until after the 
#      current voice has finished.
#    If there is no repeat on the end, 1 is the default.
#
#  Fields for stoch are name, file name, minimum amplitude, maximum amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
#    lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, minimum time till next play, maximum time till next play.
#    If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.
#
#  Fields for sample are name, file name, minimum amplitude, maximum amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
#    lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, and length of the sample (constant in seconds).
#    If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.
#
#  Fields for repeat are name, file name, minimum amplitude, maximum amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
#    lowest split allowed, highest split allowed.
#    If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.
#
#  Fields for once are name, file name, minimum amplitude, maximum amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
#    lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, when to play.
#    If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.
#
#  Fields for chronaural are name, carrier, beat, amplitude, phase, sin threshold, beat behave, 
#    beginning split, ending split, lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, split beat, and slide.
#    Beat is the frequency through time of the carrier tone.
#    Phase is the degrees that the right channel is leading the left channel, between 0 and 360.
#    Sin threshold is the value the sin function has to have before the tone is played.
#    Beat amplitude behavior is below.
#      1 sin wave  tone is adjusted by sin value
#      2 square wave  tone is either on or off
#      3 dirac delta approximation, 5th power of sin
#      4 extreme dirac delta approximation, 15th power of sin
#    If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.
#    Split beat is the frequency through time of the oscillation of the left and right split.
#    Slide indicator must be present for a slide to occur, can be continuous slide ">", step slide "&",
#    or vary slide "~".  Step slide must have number of steps, slide time, and fuzz after it.  Vary slide must
#    have number of steps and slide time after it.
#
#  Fields for pulse are name, carrier, pulse beat, amplitude, phase, pulse time,
#    beginning split, ending split, lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, split beat, and slide.
#    Pulse beat is the frequency through time of the carrier tone.
#    Phase is the degrees that the right channel is leading the left channel, between 0 and 360.
#    Pulse time is the length in seconds that the carrier should play for a pulse.  There is a 1 ms fade out
#      so it should be longer than that.  If it is longer than 1/pulse beat it will play continuously.  It is
#      a simple on-off tone, square wave.
#    If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.
#    Split beat is the frequency through time of the oscillation of the left and right split.
#    Slide indicator must be present for a slide to occur, can be continuous slide ">", step slide "&",
#    or vary slide "~".  Step slide must have number of steps, slide time, and fuzz after it.  Vary slide must
#    have number of steps and slide time after it.
#
#  Fields for phase are name, carrier frequency, beat frequency, amplitude, and phase.
#    Beat frequency is the number of times per second that the phase shifts between 0 and the current phase.
#    Phase is the phase difference in degrees between the left and right channel, from 0 to 360.
#    If beat frequency is +ve, it is the amount the right channel leads the left.
#    If beat frequency is -ve, it is the amount the left channel leads the right.
#    Optional fields are a left and right amplitude frequency variation and a left and right percentage to vary.
#    Must be at the end, before the slide indicator if they are present.
#    Slide must be > or no slide will occur.

I won't go deeply into the theory of binaural and chronaural
(sometimes called monaural) beats.  You can search the web and come up
with all kinds of information about binaural beats.  Instead, I'll
offer two analogies.

The first is of a fruit tree.  Using binaural beats is like shaking a
fruit tree when the fruit is ripe.  If you shake it gently, a few
fruit at a time fall.  The harder you shake it, the more fruit fall.
Overwhelm is having too much fruit fall for you to pick up.  Shake
gently until you get good at catching fruit.  Eventually, no more
fruit falls when you shake.

The second is of combing.  Using binaural beats is like combing a
tangled mass of hair.  If you do it gently, you slowly work the
tangles out of the hair.  If you do it with too much force, you will
rip the hair from the scalp.  Comb gently.  Once the combing is done,
the hair has no more tangles.

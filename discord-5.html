<P>Any text after a # is disregarded, whether at the start of a line or after meaningful text.</P>
<P>Options may be set in a configuration file, in fact it is easier to do so, but they must be before any time
sequences in that file.</P>
<P>A time sequence may span multiple lines, but a voice (binaural, bell, noise, etc.)
cannot be split across lines.</P>
<P>Time Sequences</P>
<P>A time sequence always starts with a duration in the format hh:mm:ss.  This may be followed with a fade indicator of &lt;for fade in or &gt; for fade out. e.g. 00:02:03&lt; means to fade in for 2 minutes and 3 seconds.  The duration is followed
by the voices that will play during that time period.</P>
<P>Separators allowed are | , ; ' =, multiples are allowed mixed with singles, any combination
of separators even within a voice.
However, every voice must be joined by separators.  No white space is allowed.
The &lt; or &gt; after the duration/time is a fade in &lt;, or fade out &gt; for that time sequence.
The &gt; after a binaural or chronaural voice is a slide, and will adjust to be the next binaural or chronaural at the
end of the time period.
All amplitudes are in percentages, 0 is none, 100 is max.
All splits are expressed as fraction for Left channel.  e.g. .3 means .3 left channel, .7 right channel
All durations in voices are expressed as seconds.  e.g. .3 = .3 second, 20 = 20 seconds, 1200 = 20 minutes
For any fields with a minimum and maximum range, setting them the same makes it a constant value.  Any time 
they are different, a random selection in the range will be made.</P>
<P>Fields for binaural are name, carrier frequency, beat frequency, and amplitude.
Optional fields are a left and right amplitude frequency variation and a left and right percentage to vary.
Optional fields must be at the end, before the slide indicator if they are present.
The + or - on the beat frequency indicates whether the left ear is higher + or lower -.
The beat is centered on the carrier frequency, so 200  +4 results in L 202 and R 198.</P>
<P>Fields for chronaural are name, carrier, amplitude, amplitude beat, amplitude fraction, amplitude behave,
beginning split, ending split, lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, split beat, and slide.
Amplitude beat is the frequency through time of the carrier tone.
Amplitude fraction is the value the sin function has to have before the tone is played.
Behavior for amp beat is below.
1 sin wave  tone is adjusted by sin value
2 square wave  tone is either on or off
3 dirac delta approximation, power of sin
If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.
Split beat is the frequency through time of the oscillation of the left and right split.
Slide must be > or no slide will occur.</P>
<P>Fields for bell are name, frequency, minimum start amplitude, maximum start amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, minimum time allowed to ring, maximum time allowed to ring,
minimum time till next ring, maximum time till next ring, and decay pattern for the ring, 1 through 5.
1 decrease linearly to 0
2 decrease linearly to .5, 
3 constant,
4 increase linearly to 1.1
5 decrease quadratically to 0  (this is the most natural sounding)
The minimum and maximum time till next play are relative to the beginning of the last play. i.e. unlike noise,
bell will interrupt itself.  The bell can start ringing again before the current ring has finished.  
It displaces the currently ringing bell.
If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.</P>
<P>Fields for noise are name, minimum start frequency, maximum start frequency, minimum start amplitude, 
maximum start amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, minimum time allowed to play, maximum time allowed to play,
minimum time till next play, maximum time till next play, minimum decay pattern for the play, 1 through 5.
maximum decay pattern for the play, 1 through 5, and the number of repeats.
1 decrease linearly to 0
2 decrease linearly to .5, 
3 constant,
4 increase linearly to 1.1
5 decrease linearly  to 1.25
If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.
Minimum decay has to be less than maximum decay or unpredicable behavior results.
The minimum and maximum time till next play are relative to the end of the last play. i.e. unlike bell,
noise will never interrupt itself.  The next voice in a slot will never start playing until after the 
current voice has finished.
If there is no repeat on the end, 1 is the default.</P>
<P>Fields for stoch are name, file name, minimum amplitude, maximum amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, minimum time till next play, maximum time till next play.
If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.</P>
<P>Fields for sample are name, file name, minimum amplitude, maximum amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, and length of the sample (constant in seconds).
If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.</P>
<P>Fields for repeat are name, file name, minimum amplitude, maximum amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
lowest split allowed, highest split allowed.
If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.</P>
<P>Fields for once are name, file name, minimum amplitude, maximum amplitude, beginning split, ending split,
lowest split allowed, highest split allowed, when to play.
If beginning split or ending split are -1, they are set randomly between lowest split and highest split.</P>
<P>There are test configuration files called binaural_test.discord, chronaural_test.discord, bell_test.discord, 
noise_test.discord, stoch_test.discord, sample_test.discord, repeat_test.discord, once_test.discord, and
frequency_loudness_test.discord.</P>

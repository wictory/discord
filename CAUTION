If used consistently (a half hour or more per day) over long periods of time (months, years), listening to binaural and
chronaural beats will cause psychological change, and might cause profound psychological change.  Presumably that is why you
are doing this, but now it is explicit.

If you are consciously aware of, or consciously suspect, that you have severe psychological traumas that you have repressed,
do not use binaural or chronaural beats until you have resolved the traumas or are comfortable that you can deal with them if
they become conscious.  Very helpful to deal with such emotional issues is EFT (www.emofree.com).  There are other effective
techniques, but I have found EFT to be easy to use, rapid, and easy to learn as well as effective.  It doesn't hurt that the
instruction manual is free, though I recommend buying The Basic Course and The Palace of Possibilities DVDs and signing up
for the free newsletter.

The use (overuse?) of binaural or chronaural beats can lead to a condition called overwhelm.  Overwhelm can be recognized by
a disinterest in living, feelings that nothing matters, why bother, irrational anger, etc.  It is caused by the disturbance
of too many emotional issues at once.  If this begins to happen, stop listening until you regain your balance.  Again, EFT
(www.emofree.com) is helpful in this regard.  Those of you on a spiritual path will recognize that overwhelm shares the same
characteristics as the beginning of true spiritual practice, dispassion.  See Rama's soliliquay at the start of the Yoga
Vasistha (Venkatesananda's version is good; if you can get his first edition, called The Supreme Yoga, even better).  The
difference is in the cause, not the nature.  Dispassion arises spontaneously, overwhelm is induced.

If you aren't careful with the amplitudes/volumes you can damage your hearing.  Start at low amplitudes/volumes and increase
slowly!

I have read on the internet that there is a slight chance that binaural or chronaural beats in the Theta range can put
susceptible people into a seizure.  I am not sure whether this is urban legend or not, as I don't recall seeing any
testimonials or descriptions of actual occurrences.  Just in case, you have been warned.

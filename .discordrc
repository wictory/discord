#      case 'a':  // audio device to set as hardware through which to route playback.
#                     Discord will use only hardware frame rates, so no resampling will occur, though
#                     the sound format will be converted by alsa to match that of the card.
#                     At a command line run the command "aplay -lLv" to find out more information about
#                     your sound card(s) and their devices.  That is not a 1, but a lowercase L.
#                     See "man aplay" or "pinfo aplay".

#                     Relevant only when sending output to a file.  All internal processing is 
#                     done using doubles regardless.

#      case 'c':  // Compensate for human hearing, low and high freqs need to be louder
#                    to have the same subjective loudness to the human ear.
#                    If this is set correctly, a sound at the compensated frequency
#                    sounds the same loudness as any other sound at its
#                    compensated frequency.  i.e. It linearizes the range
#                    This is individual, depends on your hearing, so the below is only a starting
#                    point for you to play with and tweak.  It has a max of 32 points.
#                    There is some dispute whether sounds outside the range of hearing
#                    have any effect.  Of course, that is dependent on
#                    whether those sounds even get to your ears through the system.  This
#                    applies to the internally generated sounds: binaural, chronaural, bell, noise.
#                    If you use compensation, set all amplitudes to a fixed value.
#                    Or whatever ratio between the loudness you want them to have, as if linear.
#                    The stochastic, sample, repeat and once voices are not compensated so should be
#                    set at the amplitude you want.
